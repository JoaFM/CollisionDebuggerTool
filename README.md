# CollisionDebuggerTool


I made an A-sync tool that draws a view-port that shoes you your true collision in unreal. You can use this to find bugs and see what the collision in the game really looks like. You can also select collision channels. Wish to see all the things that your bullets can hit, this tool has got you sorted. Works at run time and in editor because debugging can happen when you least expect.  

I work on my own unreal. This has not been tested really outside my own unreal. But feel free to have a look a round
